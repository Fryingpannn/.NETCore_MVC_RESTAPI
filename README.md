# CLI Commands REST API (ASP.NET Core MVC)
## With the plethora of CLI commands to learn, it is helpful to have an API which returns us commands that we often forget. This Commands API stores command line snippets along with a short description of what it does, as well as which platform it's for.
## The purpose of this project is to learn and practice concepts related to:
> - Building a REST API (routing, http, etc.) 
> - .NET Core (C#, Dependency Injection, Entity Framework Core, Data Access (DB Context), SQL Server Express, Repositories, DTO)
> - MVC Architectural Pattern
